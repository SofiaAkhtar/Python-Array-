# Array Operations in C++

This repository contains various array operations implemented in C++.

## Operations Included

1. **Array Rotation**
    - Description: Implements left and right rotations of an array.
    - File: `array_rotation.cpp`

2. **Array Sorting**
    - Description: Sorting an array using different algorithms.
    - File: `array_sorting.cpp`

3. **Array Searching**
    - Description: Searching for an element in an array.
    - File: `array_search.cpp`

## How to Use

Each operation is implemented in a separate file. You can compile and run individual files as needed.

```bash
g++ array_rotation.cpp -o array_rotation
./array_rotation

### 2. Python Array Algorithms

# Array Algorithms in Python

A collection of array-related algorithms implemented in Python.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Array Rotation**
    - Description: Implements left and right rotations of an array.
    - File: `array_rotation.py`

2. **Array Sorting**
    - Description: Sorting an array using different algorithms.
    - File: `array_sorting.py`

3. **Array Searching**
    - Description: Searching for an element in an array.
    - File: `array_search.py`

## How to Use

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file. You can run them individually.

```bash
python array_rotation.py
